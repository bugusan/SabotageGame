Reproducible Qiskit simulations for the paper "Team-Based Quantum Sabotage Game."
This repository contains the complete Python source code used to generate all figures and results for the manuscript: **"Team-Based Quantum Sabotage Game: Strategic Advantages of Entanglement and Superposition."**

The simulations use Qiskit to compare the effectiveness of classical teams (2C, 3C) against quantum-entangled teams (2Q Bell-state, 3Q W-state) in an adversarial sabotage scenario. We provide scripts for four distinct simulation types: a theoretical Hybrid Adaptive Heuristic (HAH), an ideal (noise-free) circuit simulation, simulations with standard noise models (SNM), and simulations with a calibrated noise model from real IBM Quantum hardware (`FakeKyiv`).

## üöÄ How to Run & Reproduce Results

All scripts are configured with fixed random seeds (e.g., `NP_RANDOM_SEED = 20251021`) to ensure 100% reproducibility.

### 1. Setup

Clone the repository and install the required packages.

```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
#    (Replace [YourUsername] with your GitHub username)
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourUsername]/SabotageGame.git
cd SabotageGame

# 2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run Simulations
You can run each script directly from your terminal. Each script will automatically create its own output directory (e.g., ClassicalStrategy_figures/) containing the .png plot files and .csv data files.

Bash

# Run the HAH Benchmark simulation (generates Figs 1-2)
python ClassicalStrategy.py

# Run the Ideal (Noise-Free) Circuit simulation (generates Figs 3-4)
python RealWorldStrategy.py

# Run the Standard Noise Model simulation (generates Figs 5-6)
python RealWordManualNoise.py

# Run the Hardware (Kyiv Noise) simulation (generates Figs 7-8)
python IBMNoise.py
After running all four scripts, you will have all the figures and raw data used in the paper.
